      This recording has been inspired by the recent revival of the Scottish cauldwind or bellows pipes.
      Davie Robertson is one of the most accomplished traditional artists to be connected with the
      revival and this collection of his work is long overdue. His masterly small pipe accompaniments,
      his richly authentic East Lothian Scots and the refreshing vitality of his own song compositions
      offer the best of the on-going tradition of Lowland Scotland. The blending of old and new is
      completed by the sets offered by Andy Hunter (small pipes), Davie Lockhart (fiddle) and Mike
      Ward (small pipes and harmonium).
