    'en-GB': `
        <i>Michael: A Ballad Play in Scots</i> by William Hershaw is based on the
        character of Michael Scot of Balwearie, the 12th-century philosopher, translator,
        polymath, alchemist and reputed wizard. Hershaw has combined the historical and
        folk myth aspects of the Michael Scot legend to create a gripping portrayal of a
        troubled soul who attempts to destroy the universe in order to prove the existence
        of God.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Written in lively and accessible Scots, the play takes Scottish drama to new places
        by placing a cast of devils and historical figures (including Robert Burns and Jimmy
        Shand) in the setting of traditional ballads and folklore. The result is a tragic but
        life-affirming tale brimful with dark humour, magic, horror and contemporary relevance.
