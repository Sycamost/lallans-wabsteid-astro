## New format for Eiks an Ens

Auld freinds will mind that _Eiks an Ens_ haes formerlie been a leiterar magazine

the opportunitie _Eiks_ affuirdit tae jeel our communitie thegether.

Sae this is the first issue o _Eiks_ tae tak a new format, whaur we’ll be
ettlin tae skair current affairs i the warld o Scots leid and leitratur,
especially whaur it effeirs directly til our membership.

Sae send us in your inside information! Gin ye’ve spottit somethin you think
we shuid skair in the neist _Eiks_, send it til lallans@hotmail.co.uk.
