## WayWords festival

If Edinburgh's not so convenient for you, maybe Aberdeen is better. If that's
the case, be sure to have a look at the events on offer at the fifth annual
[WayWords festival](https://www.waywordfestival.com), hosted by the University
of Aberdeen.

There's be writers, including Liz Lochhead, dance classes, Gaelic picnics, and
workshops on translation, climate change, and much more, and our member Sheena
Blackhall will be reading out her prize-winning story at the presentation of the
Toulmin Prize for Writing North East Scots.
