## AGM

Our AGM will be on Zoom on Wednesday the 11th of September, 7.00-7.30pm. If
you're a member of the Society, watch your email inbox for an invitation. If
you don't receive it, [get in touch](mailto:lallans@hotmail.co.uk)! Let us know
if there's anything you'd like to put on the agenda.

## The Orgreave Stations

On the 20th of November, our editor, Wullie Hershaw, will be launching his new
poetry book, _The Orgreave Stations_. It is a fiery and unflinching look at the
1984 miners' strike through the lens of a retelling of Christ's Passion.

[Jim Aitken](https://culturematters.org.uk/index.php/arts/poetry/item/4581-the-orgreave-stations-by-william-hershaw)
and [Alistair McIntosh](https://culturematters.org.uk/index.php/arts/poetry/item/4602-a-powerful-work-of-scottish-working-class-liberation-theology-a-review-of-the-orgreave-stations)
have already done a fine job of reviewing the book, and they emphasise the
threads which Hershaw's poems endeavour to weave together between Christianity
and Marxism.

If you're in Edinburgh on the 20th of November, we'll see you there!

## WayWords festival

If Edinburgh's not so convenient for you, maybe Aberdeen is better. If that's
the case, be sure to have a look at the events on offer at the fifth annual
[WayWords festival](https://www.waywordfestival.com), hosted by the University
of Aberdeen.

There'll be writers, including Liz Lochhead, dance classes, Gaelic picnics, and
workshops on translation, climate change, and much more, and our member Sheena
Blackhall will be reading out her prize-winning story at the presentation of the
Toulmin Prize for Writing North East Scots.
