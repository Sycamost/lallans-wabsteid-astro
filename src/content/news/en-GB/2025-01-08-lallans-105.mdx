Lallans 105 has now been dispatched to our members. It should have arrived in time for Christmas,
however, we've had some issues communicating with our printer and distributor, Alliance. If you're a
member of the Scots Language Society and haven't received Lallans 105 yet, please
<a href="/en-GB/contact">get in touch</a> and we'll work to rectify any mistakes.

We're working on diagnosing what went wrong this time and we will shortly decide a plan of action to
make sure we don't have this problem next time.
