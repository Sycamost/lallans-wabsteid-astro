## Sangschaw open for submissions!

Our annual writing competition, the _Sangschaw_, is open for submissions until
the 31st of January! As ever, we will provide feedback for every entry
regardless of whether or not you win an award. It’s unusual for competitions
like us to provide feedback on entries, but we think it’s important to help
writers develop. We have three prizes:

- The **Robert McLellan Prize for Scots Prose**: up to 3000 words of original
  Scots prose.
- The **John MacPhail Law Prize for Translation**: up to 3000 words of
  original translation into Scots from another language. Provide along with a
  copy of the original text.
- The **Hugh MacDiarmaid Tassie for Poetry**: up to 60 lines of original Scots
  poetry.

Writers new and old are all welcome, so don’t hold back! We look forward to
having your entries!

You can enter for £5 for one category, £10 for two or £12 for all three. You
can submit either by email or by post.

## New audio guide at Linlithgow Palace

This winter, the good folks at Historic Environment Scotland have translated
their audio guides for visitors into Scots for the first time. The aim is to
promote the status of the Scots language as well as to give visitors the
opportunity to hear the voices of the court in something approaching their own
language.

You can read more
<Link href="https://hes-newsroom.prgloo.com/news/new-scots-lug-in-guide-at-lithgae-palace">about the new audio guides on the Historic Environment Scotland website</Link>.

As far as we know, this is the first such venture, not only by Historic
Environment Scotland, but at any major tourist attraction. Can anybody think of
anything similar? Answers on a postcard please!

## Haven’t received Lallans 103 yet?

It has come to the attention of George, our membership secretary, that there
has been an error with the posting of _Lallans_ 103. Two members, both
subscribers entitled to issue 103, failed to receive their copies.

If you haven’t yet received your copy of _Lallans_ 103, which he posted out on
Wednesday the 7th of November, please email George at
<Link href="mailto:georgetwatt@hotmail.com">georgetwatt@hotmail.com</Link>
and make us aware of it. A copy of _Lallans_ 103 will be posted out to you
straight away!

## New format for Eiks an Ens

Old friends will recall that _Eiks an Ens_ has formerly been a literary
magazine to accompany _Lallans_. We on the Committee felt that this neither
gave _Eiks_ the distinct identity which it deserved, nor took full advantage of
the opportunity it afforded to hold our community together.

Therefore, this is the first issue of _Eiks_ to take a new format, where we’ll
be endeavouring to share current affairs in the world of Scots language and
literature, especially where it relates directly to our membership.

So send us in your inside information! If you’ve spotted something you think we
ought to share in the next _Eiks_, send it to lallans@hotmail.co.uk.
