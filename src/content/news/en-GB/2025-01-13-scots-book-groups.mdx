Open Book is an organisation that runs online reading and writing workshops.
Last year, they started a couple of regular Scots-language ones. Their aim is
to foster community and combat loneliness by sharing, and writing, poems and
stories.

In Scots, they run a Creative Writing workshop, and a Shared Reading workshop,
both once a month on Zoom. All their sessions require registration, but are
completely free.

[This month's Creative Writing session][creative-writing-eventbrite] will be
today at 11am, and [this month's Shared Reading session][shared-reading-eventbrite]
will be on the 18th at 11am.
