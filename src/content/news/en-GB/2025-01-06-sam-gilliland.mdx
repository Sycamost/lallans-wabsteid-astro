We learned last week that Sam Gilliland has died. He won this Society's Hugh MacDiarmaid Tassie for
his poetry in 2009, and published a number of poetry collections, including _A Rickle o Banes_
(Penny Wheep Press, 2009). He also organised the Scottish International Open Poetry Competition for
well over two decades. Our condolences go to his family.
