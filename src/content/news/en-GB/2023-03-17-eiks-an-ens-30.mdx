## Wittins: Sangschaw, Lallans 102-103

Our own Lord Braxfield, Judge of the Sangschaw, will deliver his summary of
this year’s happenings in Lallans 102. The word on the street is that the
cranky old grump was pretty impressed by what was put before him. So keep at
it, Scots writers - it vexes him no end to see the Scots language being put to
such good effect! It’s not too early to start working on your masterpiece for
next year. The winner of the poetry class is printed below, but the editor will
endeavour to include as many entries as possible in the forthcoming Lallans
102/103. The summer number in particular will have an extraordinary and broad
showing of further Scots writing, including an interview with Scots Radio
broadcaster Frieda Morrison; Fred Freeman’s epic on Burns, Hamish Henderson
and song; the final instalment of Sam Burns’ Deacon Broadie play and an
abundance of thought-provoking poetry, stories, reviews and news concerning
all the other ventures in the ever-expanding world of the Scots language.

## _The Galloway Hoard, Kirkcudbright Museum_ by Finola Scott

_Winner of the Hugh MacDiarmid Cup for Poetry, Sangschaw 2023_

Aw muscle and glaur, he’s preenin<br />
An muckle boastin. Yi’d think<br />
He wis the first. In he struts<br />
Aw Cock o the walk,<br />
King o Faithers, comb throbbin.<br />

Aye unnerfit, he wants tae feel<br />
Ma flutters, tae cup the load I coorie.<br />
He brags aboot the hero it’ll be.<br />
Weel mibbe, but fir noo it’s jist<br />
A wee will o the wisp, ma treisur.<br />

I shouldnae compleen, sure he broucht<br />
thon gift - a wee baa. Its hollow jinglet<br />
when I joogelt it. I thocht it a toy<br />
fir the bairn. But naw, seems it’s tae ease<br />
an bless the birthin. Whit a man.<br />
