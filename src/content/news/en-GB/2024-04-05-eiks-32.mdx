## Annual Collogue, 8t June: _Scots in Education_

We will be holding our Annual Collogue on Saturday the 8th of June!

The venue will be the Sandeman Room in the AK Bell Library, Perth. It will run
from 9.30am until 5pm.

Our theme this year will be _Scots in Education_. This is especially topical
this year, given the opening of the first teacher training programme relating to
teaching the Scots language. We are excited to welcome a variety of excellent
speakers to give us their thoughts on this important topic!

In addition, we look forward to having winners from this year’s Sangschaw
competition read their works.

We will be releasing the full programme of events very soon. In the meantime,
get it in your diaries!

## Sangschaw 2024 winners announced

As detailed in [our previous news post](/en-GB/news/2024-03-25-sangschaw-winners),
we have announced the winners of the 2024 Sangschaw. Our congratulations to all
the winners, and to everyone that submitted. The quality was higher than ever
before according to our editor, Wullie, and there were more submissions than
ever before, so we all have something to be pleased about!

## Album release: _LEID_

We said in our previous issue that Wullie was about to release his new album
with the Bowhill Players: well, if you missed it, the album is out! You can
listen to it and
[buy it on Bandcamp](https://thebowhillplayers.bandcamp.com/album/leid) for
download or as a CD. In this writer’s opinion, it’s not something you want
to miss!

## Book launch: _Library of Aethers_

The folk singer Alasdair Roberts will be in conversation with Wullie Hershaw
about his new book, _Library of Aethers_, a collection from his fine and diverse
lyric book. It includes over 70 original texts from his youth until the present,
and translations into Portuguese, Gaelic, and, of course, Scots.

The event will be in Kirkcaldy on Friday the 19th of April. You can buy
[tickets to the book launch online](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/whats-on/kirkcaldy/the-kitchen-treasury/library-of-aethers-book-launch-w-alasdair-roberts-and-william-hershaw/e-jbxzld).

## SPL pamphlet fair

We will be one of many stalls at the
[Scottish Poetry Library Pamphlet Fair](https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/spl-pamphlet-fair-2023/)
in Edinburgh on Saturday the 27th of April. Entry is free, 11am til 3pm at the
Scottish Poetry Library on Crichton Street.

## Scottish Languages Bill

The Scottish Languages Bill continues to saunter its way through the legislative
process. The Society has submitted its contribution to the public consultation
which will be considered by the
[Parliamentary Education Committee](https://www.parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/committees/current-and-previous-committees/session-6-education-children-and-young-people-committee).

We have expressed our support for the principles of the Bill, in particular that
Scots must be recognised as an official language of Scotland. We are mindful of
the diverse situations of Scots and Gaelic and have expressed our concern that
they are not treated in the same way.

We hope to publish our entire submission to the Education Committee in
due course.

Meanwhile, we hope that the Education Committee will consider our submission and
will consider calling us to present evidence in person.
